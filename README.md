## About this
This is a practice to try to create a online playable version of Quoridor game

## Main goals
My main goal is to create a playable version of Quoridor for online playing

Also, I want to create a platform like Lichess but with this game (to dream is easy!):
- **Stockfish** integration
- Previous games **database**
- Learn **tactics**/strategy
- User **login** capabilities
- Other fun stuff such as:
  - Game _variants_
  - Discussion _boards_
  - Real-time _tournaments_
  - _Whatever you want_

## Reality
I'm studing a programming degree and this could be a nice and engaging real project, but I don't feel really confident that
I can get all this goals, ==even a working game==! Please give me a chance to succeed! :joy:

## Tecnologies
Main language is **Kotlin**: **Ktor** at backend and **KVision** at frontend. All logic is kept as much as possible in Kotlin

## Roadmap
- Game board interface
- Game pawns interface
- Game corridors interface
- _I have to think more on how to continue from there_

## Versions

### v0.0.1
- Creating project
